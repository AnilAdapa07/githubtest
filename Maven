we used to have batch files and ant tool before maven but maven is capable of more automation than them. maven is an automation project tool
Maven is an automation tool which is used to automate the project execution steps
if we eneter the mvn install which is an approxly 17th step in the maven life cycle it will execute the before 16 steps also 

for this we have pom.xml file (project object model file which is in xml) this helps in downloading jars, plugins, old projects
we need to download maven first into the local
and need to set the maven bin path in the env variables path in the local
we can see the conf--> settings.xml in our local in the maven folder where we can set the user path there
maven has local repository, central repository, remote repository
first it checks in the local repo and in the central repo and next in the remote repo
if it is present in the central then it will download it and store it in the local repo and same fpr the remote repo
