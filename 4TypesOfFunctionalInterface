FunctionalInterface:
there are two type of operations one is validation to check true or false
 another is to perform the operations

 print/storing --> consumer
 return ---> supplier
 
1) consumer

 public interface i1<T> {
 void m1(T t1);                   //
 }
this has accept method. this has one input and doesn;t return anything

 2) Supplier
  public interface i2<T> {
 T m1();
 }
this has get method. this has no input but it returns .

 3) function
  public interface i3<T, R> {
 R m1(T t1);
 }
this has apply method . it takes one input of any typr and returns the output of any type

 4) predicate
  public interface i4<T> {
 boolean m1(T t1);
 }

this has test method and it takes one input and returns the boolean true or false .
